## Introduction

Machine learning plays a crucial role in various industries, including the restaurant business. In this project, we use regression to predict tips based on various factors such as total bill, party size, and more. The goal is to provide insights and potentially help restaurant owners and staff optimize their service and increase tip earnings.

## Dataset

To train and evaluate our regression models, we use the "Restaurant Tips" dataset. This dataset includes a collection of records with information on various aspects of restaurant bills and the tips provided. Before running the project, make sure to download the dataset from [data.csv](data.csv) and place it in the project's root directory.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need Python and a few libraries. We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Here are the steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tips-prediction-regression.git
cd tips-prediction-regression
