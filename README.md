## Introduction

Machine learning plays a crucial role in various industries, including the restaurant business. In this project, I used regression to predict tips based on various factors such as total bill,sex, smoker , day , time. The goal is to provide insights and potentially help restaurant owners and staff optimize their service and increase tip earnings.

## Dataset

To train and evaluate our regression models, we use the "Restaurant Tips" dataset. This dataset includes a collection of records with information on various aspects of restaurant bills and the tips provided. Before running the project, make sure to download the dataset from [tips.csv](tips.csv) and place it in the project's root directory.

## Conclusion 
By looking at the MAE(Mean Absolute Error ) values , it can be concluded that, on average there is an error of 0.70 for predictions, which means that on average there is an error of 0.70 for predictions, which means that on average, the predicted tip values are 0.70$ more or less than the actual tip values.
